## 🎯 What is This?

The Claude Code Playbook is a **skills-based system** that helps developers maximize value from Claude Pro subscriptions while maintaining code quality. It transforms traditional multi-turn AI conversations into efficient, predictable workflows.

### The Problem
- Claude Pro has hard token limits (10-40 prompts per 5 hours)
- Traditional chat workflows waste tokens on back-and-forth
- Simple refactoring tasks often require 5-10+ conversation turns
- No standardized approach to budget-aware AI collaboration

### The Solution
- **6 executable workflows** that compress common tasks
- **Empirical token costs** for predictable budget planning
- **67% reduction** in conversation turns
- **100% test pass rate** maintained through validation gates

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dyb5784/claude-code-playbook.git
cd claude-code-playbook

# Upload to Claude Project
# 1. Open claude.ai
# 2. Create or open a Project
# 3. Upload the .claude/ directory to Project Knowledge
# 4. Upload CLAUDE.md to Project Knowledge
```

### Your First Session

```bash
# In Claude Code or claude.ai Project:

# Initialize session
/clear
claude skills refactoring qnew

# Analyze your codebase
claude skills refactoring triage

# Get your top 3 technical debt priorities!
```

## 📊 Available Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Cost | When to Use |
|----------|---------|------|-------------|
| **triage** | Find top 3 technical debt hotspots | ~2K tokens | Start of project |
| **qnew** | Initialize session with context | ~2K tokens | Start of work day |
| **qplan** | Validate refactoring plan | ~3K tokens | Before implementation |
| **extract** | Extract function to new module | ~5K tokens | Targeted decomposition |
| **modernize** | Update to modern patterns | ~4K tokens | Pattern upgrades |
| **qcode** | Full implementation (max 15 files) | ~8-12K tokens | Execute approved plan |
| **catchup** | Restore context after `/clear` | ~1-2K tokens | Every 5-7 prompts |

### Invoke Workflows

## 💡 Key Features

### Modern Architecture Patterns
- Feature-based module structure
- Result<T,E> monads for error handling
- Functional composition over classes
- Configuration-driven logic
- Dependency injection via factory functions

### Budget Management
- Session reset protocol (`/clear` + `catchup` every 5-7 prompts)
- Token usage checkpoints
- Predictable costs per operation
- Empirically tested on production codebases

### Quality Gates
Every change must pass:
- ✅ Type check (0 errors)
- ✅ Unit tests (all passing)
- ✅ Lint (0 warnings)

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner (Sessions 1-2)
1. Run `qnew` to start
2. Use `triage` to understand your codebase
3. Extract 1 simple function with `extract`
4. Practice `/clear` + `catchup` protocol

### Intermediate (Sessions 3-10)
1. Use `qplan` before extractions
2. Extract 2-3 functions per session
3. Apply `modernize` to update patterns
4. Track progress in `REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md`

### Advanced (Sessions 10+)
1. Use `qcode` for batch operations (10-15 files)
2. Design custom extraction strategies
3. Contribute patterns back to knowledge base
